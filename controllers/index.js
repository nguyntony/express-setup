// this file will require from other controller files and then have an export statement

// EXAMPLE
// module.exports = {
//     homeController: require('./home'),
//     productController: require('./products'),
// }

// NOTE
// in each of the controller files you will have to import the model and also layout (partials)
// lastly, you will export the controller functions in each individual file as an object then require them in here.
